# SmartStudy AI

SmartStudy AI is a web application developed for the [CitroHacks 2023 hackathon](https://citro-hacks-2023.devpost.com/) that won 1st place. It aims to assist students in their online learning by providing various features such as automatic note generation from YouTube videos, video summarization, and the ability to generate slideshows from textbook images. The application also provides relevant Wikipedia links to facilitate further learning on the topics discussed in the video or textbook.

## Features

### YouTube Video Note Generation

SmartStudy AI allows users to input a YouTube video link, and it generates detailed notes with timestamps for each bulletpoint. This feature enables students to quickly review important concepts covered in educational videos without having to watch the entire content repeatedly.

### Video Summarization

With the video summarization feature, SmartStudy AI generates a condensed version of the YouTube video that only includes the most important sections. This functionality enables students to get a quick overview of the video's content and identify key points without spending excessive time on watching the entire video.

### Wikipedia Link Generation

SmartStudy AI automatically generates relevant Wikipedia links based on the topics discussed in the video. These links provide additional resources and references for students to delve deeper into the subject matter and expand their knowledge beyond the video content.

### Textbook Image to Slideshow Conversion

Users can upload images of textbook pages to SmartStudy AI, and the application will scan the image to generate a slideshow. The generated slides include bulletpoints extracted from the image content, along with relevant images to enhance understanding. Additionally, an audio component is provided that reads more information than just the bulletpoints, making the learning experience more immersive and comprehensive.
